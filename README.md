# Dynamic-Programming

Dynamic programming algorithms and resolutions.

Why in Java? I am recently working on a golang data structure lib [tgods](https://github.com/cuzfrog/tgods),
coding in golang is simple, fast, smooth, and fluent. Yet "languages are tools". It's time to have some "classic Java" taste.
Also, Java is widely used in many textbooks and training courses, thus more friendly to audience.

## Algorithms

1. The vanilla `fibonacci sequence`.
