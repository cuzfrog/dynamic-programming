# Dynamic-Programming

Dynamic programming algorithms and resolutions.

Why in Java? I am recently working on a golang data structure framework [tgods](https://github.com/cuzfrog/tgods),
coding in golang is simple, fast, smooth, and fluent. Yet "languages are tools". It's time to have some "classic Java" taste.
Also, Java is widely used in many textbooks and training courses, thus more friendly to audience.

## Algorithms

1. [`fibonacci sequence`](./src/main/java/com/github/cuzfrog/fibonacci)
2. [`matrix paths`](./src/main/java/com/github/cuzfrog/matrixpath) Find how many paths are there to travel a matrix.
3. [`can sum`](./src/main/java/com/github/cuzfrog/cansum) Check if a sum can be achieved by adding up given numbers.
